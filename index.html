        <h1>The Plot</h1>
        On Halloween, Gotham City mayor Don Mitchell Jr. is murdered by a masked
        psychopath calling himself the Riddler. Reclusive billionaire Bruce
        Wayne, who has operated for two years as the vigilante Batman,
        investigates the murder alongside the Gotham City Police Department
        (GCPD). Lieutenant James Gordon discovers a message that the Riddler
        left for Batman. The following night, the Riddler kills commissioner
        Pete Savage and leaves another message for Batman. Batman and Gordon
        discover that the Riddler left a thumb drive in Mitchell's car
        containing images of Mitchell with a woman, Annika Kosolov, at the
        Iceberg Lounge—a nightclub operated by the Penguin, mobster Carmine
        Falcone's lieutenant. While the Penguin pleads ignorance, Batman notices
        that Selina Kyle, Annika's roommate and friend, works at the club as a
        waitress. When Annika disappears, Batman sends Selina back to the
        Iceberg Lounge for answers and discovers that Savage was on Falcone's
        payroll, as is district attorney Gil Colson. The Riddler abducts Colson,
        straps a timed collar bomb to his neck, and sends him to interrupt
        Mitchell's funeral. When Batman arrives, the Riddler calls him via
        Colson's phone and threatens to detonate the bomb if Colson cannot
        answer three riddles. Colson refuses to answer the third—the name of the
        informant who gave the GCPD information that led to a historic drug bust
        ending mobster Salvatore Maroni's operation—and dies. Batman and Gordon
        deduce that the informant may be the Penguin and track him to a drug
        deal. They discover that Maroni's operation transferred to Falcone, with
        many corrupt GCPD officers involved. Selina inadvertently exposes them
        when she arrives to steal money and discovers Annika's corpse in a car
        trunk. After a car chase, Batman captures the Penguin but learns he is
        not the informant. Batman and Gordon follow the Riddler's trail to the
        ruins of an orphanage funded by Bruce's murdered parents, Thomas and
        Martha Wayne, where they learn that the Riddler holds a grudge against
        the Wayne family. Bruce's butler and caretaker, Alfred Pennyworth, is
        hospitalized after opening a letter bomb addressed to Bruce. The Riddler
        leaks evidence that Thomas, who was running for mayor before he was
        murdered, hired Falcone to kill a journalist for threatening to reveal
        details about Martha and her family's history of mental illness. Bruce,
        who grew up believing his father was morally upstanding, confronts
        Alfred, who maintains that Thomas only asked Falcone to threaten the
        journalist into silence; Thomas planned to turn himself and Falcone over
        to the police once he found out Falcone murdered the journalist instead.
        Alfred believes that Falcone had Thomas and Martha killed to prevent
        this. Selina reveals to Batman that Falcone is her neglectful father.
        She decides to kill him after learning that he strangled Annika because
        Mitchell told her that Falcone was the informant. Batman and Gordon
        arrive in time to stop her, but the Riddler kills Falcone as he is being
        arrested. The Riddler is unmasked as forensic accountant Edward Nashton
        and is incarcerated in Arkham State Hospital, where he tells Batman he
        took inspiration from him when targeting the corrupt. Batman learns that
        Nashton has stationed car bombs around Gotham and cultivated an online
        following that plans to assassinate mayor-elect Bella Reál. The bombs
        destroy the seawall around Gotham and flood the city. Nashton's
        followers attempt to kill Reál but are stopped by Batman and Selina. In
        the aftermath, Nashton befriends another inmate,[a] while Selina deems
        Gotham beyond saving and leaves. Batman aids recovery efforts and vows
        to inspire hope in Gotham.

        Robert Pattinson as Bruce Wayne / Batman: A reclusive billionaire who
        obsessively protects Gotham City as a masked vigilante to cope with his
        traumatic past.Batman is around 30 years old and is not yet an
        experienced crime fighter,as director Matt Reeves wanted to explore the
        character before he becomes "fully formed".Reeves and Pattinson
        described Batman as an insomniac who cannot delineate between the Batman
        persona and his "recluse rockstar" public identity as Bruce,with Reeves
        comparing his obsession with being Batman to a drug addiction. Pattinson
        said the film questions the nature of heroism, as Batman is more flawed
        than traditional superheroes[15] and unable to control himself, seeking
        to work out his rage and "inflict his kind of justice".Reeves considered
        The Batman a story about Batman learning that he must not exact
        vengeance, but inspire hope. Oscar Novak portrays a young Bruce, while
        Rick English was Pattinson's stunt double. Zoë Kravitz as Selina Kyle /
        Catwoman: A nightclub waitress, drug dealer, and cat burglar who meets
        Batman while searching for her missing roommate;her moral ambiguity
        challenges Batman's black-and-white view of good and evil.Kravitz said
        the character is becoming a femme fatale and "figuring out who she is,
        beyond just someone trying to survive".She described her as a mysterious
        character with unclear motivations,who represents femininity in contrast
        to Batman's masculinity.She said the pair are "partner[s] in
        crime",drawn together by their desire to fight for vulnerable people.
        Reeves saw Selina as Batman's awakening to his own sheltered upbringing
        and preconceived assumptions.Kravitz focused more on Selina than her
        Catwoman persona because she did not want to distract from the
        character's emotional journey, and interpreted Selina as bisexual, like
        the comics. Paul Dano as Edward Nashton / Riddler: A forensic accountant
        who is inspired by Batman to become a serial killer who targets elite
        Gotham citizens and livestreams his crimes.He seeks to "unmask the
        truth" about Gotham, taunting Batman and law enforcement with
        riddles.Reeves said Batman inspiring the Riddler reflects the idea from
        the comics that he creates his own enemies and that the Riddler's attack
        on Gotham gives the character a "political agenda" as a terrorist-like
        figure. He found Batman and the Riddler being "kind of two sides of the
        same coin" unsettling, as they have similar goals.He likened the Riddler
        to the Zodiac Killer, who he felt was the "real-life" Riddler for his
        practice of communicating with ciphers and riddles,while Dano said his
        performance balanced the real-life basis with the Batman franchise's
        theatricality.Joseph Walker portrays a young Nashton. Jeffrey Wright as
        James Gordon: An ally of Batman in the Gotham City Police Department
        (GCPD). He is the only GCPD officer whom Batman trusts, and they work
        together to solve the Riddler case. Wright described Gordon as "relative
        to Gotham City, to the Gotham City Police Department, to Batman, to
        justice and to corruption".Similar to Christopher Nolan's The Dark
        Knight Trilogy (2005-2012), Gordon begins as a GCPD lieutenant in The
        Batman, allowing his progression to commissioner to be depicted in
        subsequent films.Wright felt starting Gordon as the lieutenant enabled
        him to play a larger role compared to previous film iterations.Reeves
        felt that Batman and Gordon's partnership is emphasized more in The
        Batman than it was in previous Batman films, and compared them to Carl
        Bernstein (Dustin Hoffman) and Bob Woodward (Robert Redford) from All
        the President's Men (1974). John Turturro as Carmine Falcone: A Gotham
        crime lord and Selina's father.The Riddler's primary target,Falcone has
        much of Gotham under his control; Turturro described him as a "dangerous
        guy",while Reeves said he was "seemingly...a genteel mobster but [he]
        turns out to have a very, very dark history behind him" and compared him
        to Noah Cross (John Huston) from Chinatown (1974).The Batman suggests
        that Falcone played a role in Batman's origin story by ordering the
        murder of Thomas and Martha Wayne.<br />

        Falcone wears vintage sunglasses throughout the film, as Turturro felt
        the character needed a "mask".Peter Sarsgaard as Gil Colson: Gotham's
        district attorney,whom Sarsgaard described as untruthful and
        "distasteful".Andy Serkis as Alfred Pennyworth: Batman's butler and
        mentor,though they have a strained relationship and rarely
        speak.Pattinson described Alfred as Batman's only confidant, even though
        Alfred "thinks he's gone insane!" Unlike previous film incarnations,
        Alfred has a military background, which is reflected in him being "used
        to rules and regulations, structure and precision" as well as his dress
        and demeanor. To illustrate Alfred's physical appearance as a military
        veteran, Reeves came up with the idea of him having a cane, while Serkis
        suggested his facial scars. Serkis shared that Alfred was "part of the
        secret service and then the security team looking after Wayne
        Enterprises"; his background led to him becoming more of a "mentor and a
        teacher" than the father figure that Bruce needed.Reeves noted that
        Alfred was forced into becoming Bruce's parental figure despite being
        inexperienced, and feels guilty that his parenting of Bruce might have
        led to his obsessive journey as Batman.Colin Farrell as Oswald "Oz"
        Cobblepot / Penguin: Falcone's chief lieutenant who operates the Iceberg
        Lounge, the nightclub where Selina works. He is not yet the crime
        kingpin he is depicted as in the comics, and dislikes being referred to
        as the Penguin. Reeves explained that the Penguin is a "mid-level
        mobster guy and he's got a bit of showmanship to him, but you can see
        that he wants more and that he's been underestimated". Reeves compared
        the Penguin to Fredo Corleone (John Cazale) from The Godfather (1972),
        due to "the insignificance that he lives within, in a family that is
        full of very strong, very bright, very capable, very violent men."[53]
        Additionally, Jayme Lawson portrays Bella Reál, a mayoral candidate for
        Gotham City who Reeves said represents hope; Gil Perez-Abraham portrays
        Martinez, a GCPD officer; Peter McDonald portrays William Kenzie, a
        corrupt GCPD officer; Alex Ferns portrays Pete Savage, the GCPD
        commissioner; Con O'Neill portrays Mackenzie Bock, the GCPD chief; and
        Rupert Penry-Jones portrays Don Mitchell Jr., Gotham's mayor. Barry
        Keoghan makes a cameo appearance as the Joker (credited as "Unseen
        Arkham Prisoner"), while other cast members include twins Charlie and
        Max Carver as Iceberg Lounge bouncers (credited as "The Twins"); Hana
        Hrzic as Annika, Selina's roommate; Jay Lycurgo as a young gang member;
        Akie Kotabe as a train passenger; Sandra Dickinson as Dory, Bruce's
        caretaker and housekeeper; and Luke Roberts and Stella Stocker as
        Bruce's parents, Thomas and Martha Wayne.

        <h1>Music</h1>
        In October 2019, Reeves announced that his frequent collaborator Michael
        Giacchino would be composing the film's score. Later that month,
        Giacchino said he had already finished writing the main theme for the
        film because he was so excited to do so; because this music was written
        much earlier in the production than is usual for a film, Giacchino and
        Reeves were able to use it in promotional materials. Giacchino said he
        felt total freedom to write the music that he wanted for the film,
        agreeing with Reeves that this was their vision of Batman similar to how
        different comic book and graphic novel authors and artists over the
        years had been able to create different takes on the character.
        Giacchino completed the score in October 2021, and his main theme was
        released as a single on January 21, 2022. Giacchino's theme for the
        Riddler was released as a single on February 4, and his Catwoman theme
        was released as the third and final single on February 17. The full
        soundtrack album was released on February 25. "Something in the Way"
        appears twice in the film, and was noted to have a similar baseline to
        Giacchino's score. He acknowledged this, but said it was a lucky
        coincidence. "Ave Maria" by Franz Schubert is also featured and was
        performed by the Tiffin Boys' Choir and Dano.

        <h1>Visual Effects</h1>
        Dan Lemmon served as the visual effects supervisor, after previously
        collaborating with Reeves on the Planet of the Apes films. Visual
        effects vendors included Wētā FX, ILM, Scanline VFX, and Crafty Apes,
        with over 1,500 visual effects shots created on a $20 million budget.
        According to Lemmon, "ILM led the work on Gotham, and their StageCraft
        group handled the real-time LED backgrounds during production. Scanline
        VFX took on most of the third act and the heavy simulation work. Wētā FX
        did the Batmobile chase and a few other standalone environments. And
        then Crafty Apes did a substantial amount of our 2D work, with splits,
        retimes, stabilizations, monitors and other cleanup work". Chinland
        designed the Gotham cityscape so it could be created digitally by ILM
        and displayed in the background of scenes using the StageCraft
        technology. He used plate shots from London, New York, and Chicago;
        according to Lemmon, Reeves wanted the cityscapes to capture the "forms,
        architecture, and the fabric of the city to look like it was really in
        decay." Chinland originated the idea to place the Bat-Signal on an
        abandoned building rather than on top of the GCPD building. Due to the
        COVID-19 pandemic, a majority of the buildings were created using
        computer generated imagery (CGI). Lemmon stated that using Unreal Engine
        to render the LED-walls in real time helped the team plan out the
        logistics for filming various scenes, such as "how big the sets needed
        to be, where process screens would go, what the extensions would look
        like through the camera, where stunt rigging and special effects
        equipment would go", and also allowing Fraser to adjust the lighting.
        Portable LED screens showing advertisements were used when filming
        scenes in Gotham Square to augment the lighting of the jumbotrons in
        post. Wētā FX created over 320 VFX shots for the film. It was
        responsible for fleshing out the Batmobile chase; it used CGI to add
        rain and vehicles and helped form the "beats" of the chase, such as when
        the Penguin causes a fuel truck explosion. One of Wētā's biggest tasks
        was replicating Fraser's lighting, achieved using the Manuka renderer
        and virtual cinematography. In addition, the team bought glass plates
        and silicone sealant to replicate Fraser's process of inserting silicone
        on the lenses. Scanline VFX created over 217 VFX shots across 11
        sequences, including the destruction of the water dams, the tsunami
        rushing towards Gotham Square Gardens, and Catwoman's burglary. For the
        burglary, the team used digital doubles for Pattinson and Kravitz and
        facial replacements for footage filmed with stunt doubles. Simulations
        were used to replicate water, architectural destruction, fire, smoke,
        and electric arcing for the final act. The team used Eyeline Studios'
        volumetric capture tools to replace the stunt doubles' faces. The
        overall arena set was the only one that used blue screens; the teams
        used photography from O2 to create the background. The team created
        additional setups to match Fraser's process of inserting caulk on the
        lenses, which he used to create the "spiderweb-like lens flares". The
        crowds were generated using CGI.

        rating of 85% based on 492 reviews, with an average rating of 7.6/10.
        The site's critical consensus reads, "A grim, gritty, and gripping
        super-noir, The Batman ranks among the Dark Knight's bleakest – and most
        thrillingly ambitious – live-action outings." Metacritic, which uses a
        weighted average, assigned the film a score of 72 out of 100, based on
        68 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews". Audiences polled
        by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of "A–" on an A+ to F
        scale, while those at PostTrak gave it an 87% positive score (with an
        average 4.5 out of 5 stars), with 71% saying they would definitely
        recommend it. IGN contributor Alex Stedman gave a 10 out of 10 rating,
        writing, "The Batman is a gripping, gorgeous, and at times genuinely
        scary psychological crime thriller that gives Bruce Wayne the grounded
        detective story he deserves." Writing for The National, Jason Mottram
        called the film "one of the darkest and most compelling comic-book
        movies of the modern era" while praising the performances, action
        sequences and story. Digital Spy reviewer Ian Sandwell praised the
        performances and felt that "It's easy to get Batman wrong, but Reeves
        never even threatens to do so. The Batman is an enthralling, chilling
        and fresh new take on the iconic DC hero that'll leave you desperate for
        another visit to this impeccably-crafted world." Clarisse Loughrey of
        The Independent gave the film a rating of 4/5 and wrote "Matt Reeves's
        take on the Caped Crusader may not be a genre-defining miracle, but it
        delivers a tapered-down, intimate portrait, while Zoe Kravitz's Catwoman
        brings an almost-extinct sensuality to the role".Ann Hornaday from The
        Washington Post rated the film 1.5 out of 4 stars, criticizing the film
        for its dark visuals and its lengthy runtime, calling it "yet another
        lugubrious, laboriously grim slog masquerading as a fun comic book
        movie." Similarly, A.O. Scott of The New York Times also criticized the
        film for its dark visuals, in addition to saying the film has too much
        exposition, but praised the performances from the cast and Giacchino's
        score, and ultimately concluded by stating "I can’t say I had a good
        time, but I did end up somewhere I didn’t expect to be: looking forward

        <h1>My Review</h1>

        I think the biggest question I had while watching The Batman was “how
        has Jim Gordon still got a job?” Most police officers appearing in crime
        squares armed with body armor and Robert Pattinson's 1000-yard stance
        would probably not have lasted long in law enforcement. But he does do
        it anyway, and Pattinson continues to stand like a little ironing board,
        and then distort the evidence, ask the police, and hold the details -
        and no one seems to really care. Sometimes you hit a lot of cops and
        that’s okay. Of course, this is a comic book film after all, despite the
        beauty and atmosphere they often do their best to do it differently. Yet
        there is a world in Matt Reeves' epic that somehow everything sounds
        based on. Even if Batman and Catwoman are wandering around in what can
        easily be passed over to the idols, there is something unquestionably
        believed in all of this. It became clear at the time that he was not an
        all-powerful hero - Bat Signal did a lot of work for him, silencing a
        lot of low-level criminals while being smoked. Then he does his best
        until the sun rises. He is not perfect, but he is very active.The movie
        adaptations of DC’s Caped Crusader have been nothing if not pendulous,
        but if anything it’s Robert Pattinson’s version of Bruce Wayne that
        feels so different to what we’ve seen before. There’s none of the usual
        swagger and confidence, neither of Michael Keaton’s charming socialite
        nor Christian Bale’s pretend playboy. Pattinson’s Bruce Wayne is a
        mop-haired misery obsessed with fighting crime to the detriment of all
        else in his life, but he fits the world Reeves has built perfectly. And
        besides, at just shy of three hours long, The Batman can’t afford to
        waste screen time on corporate mergers or whatever it is Bruce Wayne
        actually does for a living. So instead we get more duality between the
        crime-fighting persona and the real man than perhaps ever before. You
        couldn’t look at this version of Wayne and even connect him to the
        unstoppable justice machine he becomes behind the cowl. To his credit,
        Pattinson plays both personas almost flawlessly. This is him shedding
        the last clinging vestiges of Edward Cullen, if you believe he needs to
        at all. He carries a rare kind of constrained rage around whether as
        Wayne or the Batman, always on the verge of losing his shit with
        everyone. Anyone. Pattinson and Reeves do an incredible job of
        positioning Batman as the anchor point for the entire movie. And while
        that sounds like it should be obvious, it’s important to consider how
        many times the Batman character has been overshadowed for whatever
        reason. Jack Nicholson and Heath Ledger stole the show as two very
        different versions of the Joker, Batman Forever felt more like a Jim
        Carrey film than a Val Kilmer film, and Batman Returns belonged to Danny
        DeVito. But The Batman is Pattinson’s, always. He remains the focal
        point throughout, commanding the screen in every scene and filling the
        surrounding space with simmering menace. That said, the supporting cast
        is incredibly strong. Andy Serkis’ Alfred feels closest to Sean
        Pertwee’s iteration in TV’s Gotham, all stoic, British, and a slightly
        better detective than the big guy in black. Meanwhile Paul Dano is both
        terrifying and compelling as the Riddler, channelling wisps of Joker and
        Scarecrow through his portrayal. I’m still not sure Gary Oldman’s Gordon
        can be bettered, but Jeffrey Wright is fantastic here. He’s a good cop
        doing his best in a broken, corrupt city where vigilantes are more
        trustworthy than trained police officers. Elsewhere there’s Zoe Kravitz,
        putting the cat back into Catwoman with far more integrity and
        enthusiasm than anyone since Michelle Pfeiffer. She’s vulnerable but
        capable, physically weaker than most of the goons she squares up to but
        fearless in the pursuit of what she wants – in this instance good
        old-fashioned revenge against John Turturro’s scenery-chewing gangster,
        Carmine Falcone. And finally, of course, is Colin Farrell, whose
        portrayal of Oswald Cobblepot is so good you forget it’s actually a
        roguishly handsome Irish guy in very heavy makeup. If there’s a
        complaint here it’s that I often felt that the action intruded on the
        character development. The Batman is at its strongest when it focuses on
        the interplay between the players, to the point that the action scenes
        felt almost like an afterthought, something inserted to check a list
        rather than serve a real purpose. Reeves goes to pains to make the
        fisticuffs look heavy and dirty and gritty, then sprinkles comic book
        stuff throughout that threatens to tip the balance too far the other
        way. It’s saying that the only time you’re really reminded that it’s a
        comic book movie is when Pattinson careens off a skyscraper and smashes
        through half a dozen obstacles on his way to a full-speed collision with
        the ground, before getting up as if he’d just tripped up a doorstep. Or
        maybe when he tanks a shotgun blast from three feet away. Or does that
        thing where he somehow vanishes when the person, he’s with blinks for a
        second. Is this the best Batman movie ever? Some will say yes, others
        no. For me, it’s on par with The Dark Knight and just slightly ahead of
        Batman 1989, so very nearly almost, yes. It’s an astonishingly well-shot
        film that somehow manages to fly by even at almost three hours long.
        It’s less of a mystery than it wants to be, but only because when you
        finally begin to connect the dots between the Riddler’s victims it’s a
        bit, well, anticlimactic. But as a study of the Batman and the city he
        protects, it’s an absolute triumph.
